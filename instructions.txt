Data transferring program
The program consists of two main modules: client and writer. The client reads a file given as a parameter. After reading the data, client sends the data to the writer. Writer creates a file containing data from the client. The writer writes a file which is named after the timestamp at the time writing the file and the pid got from client.
Thereâ€™s a self-made logging tool, which is used for logging entries from client and server and writes these to log.


Instructions:

Writer can (and must be opened) once only. This works by going to the directory, compiling the source code with the Makefile given (make) and then executing the binary:
./writer

A separate client must be opened for each file. After compiling the code, client can be executed by following command:
./client <file>
where <file> is the name of the file which is wanted to be transferred (for example, ./client test.log). 
User can set many parameters when starting the client, but only the first one will be acknowledged by the client.
